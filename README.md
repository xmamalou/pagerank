# PARALLEL SYSTEMS -- PAGERANK IMPLEMENTATION

This is my pagerank implementation for the extra project of the "Parallel Systems" course of the Computer Engineering Masters of NKUA.

## HOW TO BUILD
Building is easy and automated; just use one of the script files provided in the `scripts/` directory. You need CMake to build this project.

>[!NOTE]
> The build scripts by default assume that if you have Ninja installed, you will want to use *it* instead of Make. Use `--no-weeb` to override this assumption
